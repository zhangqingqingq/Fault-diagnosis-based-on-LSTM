# Fault diagnosis based on LSTM
## Dataset
  To verify the effciency of the proposed method, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process is applied to do experiment.The TE process was first created by Down and Vogel of the American chemical company Tennessee Eastman.It has widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of some
process diagnosis methods. The process flow chart is shown in figure 3. This process has four starting materials: A,C, D and E, tow products: G and H, plus a by-product:F. The whole reaction process contains an inert gas: B, it is used as the main catalyst for the reaction. TE process has five major operating units, they are respectively the Reactor, Condenser, Compressor, Separator and Stripper. The
TE process has 41 measurement variables and 12 operation variables. We select 52 variables(41 measurement variables and 11 operation   variables) for monitoring. Besides the TE process includes 21 predefined perturbations (from fault 1 to fault 21).
